# Hangman

Welcome to **Hangman**, a classic game.

We all remember playing hangman as a kid on a piece of paper. With this little program you can easily play it in your terminal! 
You can guess one or multiple characters. After 10 false guesses, the game is lost. 
Guessing the same wrong character twice will give you two errors, so pay attention on what you have already guessed so far. You don't have to memorize all your guesses, they will be displayed for you.

**Have fun**
